# Diamond Project Ontology

## Overview

The Diamond Project Ontology is a semantic framework designed to represent and organize the structure, resources, competencies, and outputs of the DIAMOND project under the DIADEM PEPR initiative. This ontology provides a formal representation of project entities and their relationships, enabling better data management, knowledge sharing, and interoperability.


## Purpose
This ontology serves to:

- Structure project organization: Define work packages, partners, and personnel
- Document competencies: Catalog skills and expertise areas within the project
- Track resources: Manage software tools, databases, and other project resources
- Record outputs: Represent deliverables, products, and workflows
- Enable FAIR data practices: Support findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable research data
